# Nanobody Design (VHH/VNAR)

Tools that explicitly model antibody or VHH frameworks and CDR logic, plus near-neighbor tools commonly used in nanobody programs.

## VHH-focused

- RFantiboy
- Germinal
- EvolveX
- mBER
- BoltzGen
- ODesign
- FoldCraft
- Nanodesigner
- GeoFlow-V2 / GeoFlow-V3
- nanoFOLD

## CDR design and affinity maturation

- HalluDesign
- UniMoMo
- MFDesign

## Notes

In practice, pair sequence generation with structure or complex prediction and only then apply affinity and stability scoring.
