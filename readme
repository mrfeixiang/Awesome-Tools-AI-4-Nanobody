## Scope

This list focuses on tools that directly support nanobody discovery and engineering:

* Sequence generation or optimization (VHH/VNAR, CDR)
* Structure prediction for nanobodies and complexes
* Binder design frameworks that can be used to produce nanobody-like binders or accelerate target interface exploration
* Affinity and stability predictors, including ΔΔG and PPI scoring
* Sampling methods for ensembles and IDR-related interactions when relevant
* Agents that automate literature, hypothesis iteration, and design loops
* Benchmarks and datasets that help evaluate models in realistic settings

## End-to-end nanobody design and optimization

These are “pipeline-like” tools or families you can string together for a full design loop.

* **IgGM**
  Antibody framework oriented design workflows, often used as a starting point for VHH-style tasks.

* **Germinal**
  Antibody-focused design and optimization tool family, relevant to nanobody sequence and CDR exploration.

* **Chai-2**
  Antibody and VHH-relevant design workflow tool mentioned in your list.

* **JAM-2**
  Antibody and VHH-relevant design workflow tool mentioned in your list.

Tip: In practice, an end-to-end loop tends to look like “generate sequences → predict structure/complex → score affinity and stability → filter for developability → iterate with active learning and wet-lab feedback.”
